//after defining association the field must be specified in the model or else our library will have no way to know existance of that relation


/* virtual field __title__ should be added in model for better readibility in admin pannel  */



//define extra field options on admin pannel like this
//const adminPannel = new AdminPannel("sequelize", sequelize, app, {
//  titleFields: { Actor: ["id", "successor"], ActorMovies: ["ActorId"] },
//});
after defining custom fields if user still want to show the title then it should be added '__title__' in the list
